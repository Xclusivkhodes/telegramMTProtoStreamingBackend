/**
 * graphql/resolvers/resolvers.ts — Schema Assembly Point
 *
 * This file is the final assembly step for the GraphQL layer:
 *   1. Merges all resolver modules into one object
 *   2. Builds an executable schema (typeDefs + resolvers)
 *   3. Wraps it with graphql-shield permission middleware
 *
 * The exported schemaWithPermissions is passed directly to ApolloServer
 * as its `schema` option — no separate typeDefs/resolvers options needed.
 *
 * To add a new resolver module:
 *   import it and add it to resolverArray below.
